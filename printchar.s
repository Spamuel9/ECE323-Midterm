; The Print_Character subroutine is designed to display a single character on an LCD screen. This subroutine is essential for applications requiring real-time data display, such as user interfaces or debug information outputs. The character to be displayed is passed through R5, and the subroutine ensures it's printed at the current cursor position on the LCD.

 AREA PROGRAM, CODE, READONLY
 EXPORT printchar
 IMPORT LCD_command
 
printchar
	PUSH {R0, R1, LR} ; Saves the context of R0, R1, and the Link Register to preserve the execution state before making the call to LCD_command.

	; Prepares the character stored in R5 and the command to write the character to the LCD.
	MOVS R0, R5 ; Moves the character from R5 to R0, as R0 is used by the LCD_command subroutine to receive its input.
	MOVS R1, #1 ; Sets R1 to indicate that the operation is to write a character to the LCD, not a command.

	BL LCD_command ; Calls the LCD_command subroutine, which handles the communication with the LCD to display the character.

	POP {R0, R1, PC} ; Restores the saved registers and returns from the subroutine, continuing execution from where it was called.
	END
